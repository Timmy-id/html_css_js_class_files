1. Variables

   - This is used for storing data
   - to declare a variable, we can use var, let, const
   - Variables should begin with a letter or an underscore.
   - Variables are case sensitive.

2. Data types

   - string - Any set of characters enclosed in a single quote, double quotes, backticks
   - number - Any integer or decimal number.
   - boolean - true or false
   - undefined - This is the type we get when a variable has not been assigned a value
   - null - This indicates that a value does not exist.

3. JavaScript is a loosely typed language because it doesn't require you to specify the type when declaring a variable.

4. Browser DevTools

   - This is a set of web developer tools that allow us to test or modify our website/code from the browser.

5. Arrays

   - Array is a way of storing multiple data. The data can be of different types. It uses a [] to store the data.

   - Array methods

     - toString() - helps in converting the data in the array to a string.

     - join() - helps in convertin the data in the array to a string but can accept a parameter which can be used for separating the data in the array.

     - push() - helps in adding data to our array. It adds the data to the end.

     - pop() - helps in removing the last element in the array.

     - unshift() - helps in adding a new item to the start of our array.

     - shift() - helps in removing the first element in the array.

   - Selecting items in an array
     - Arrays are 0 index based.

6. Operators

   - An operator is a symbol that indicates how to combine one or more values into an expression.
   - We have six (6) groups of operators in JavaScript
     1. Arithmetic Operators - indicates mathematical functions
        - addition (+)
        - subtraction (-)
        - multiplication (\*)
        - division (/)
        - modulus (%)
        - increment (++)
        - decremment (--)
     2. Assignment Operators
        - =
        - +=
        - -=
        - /=
        - \*=
     3. Comparison operators
        - == (is equal in value)
        - != (not equal to)
        - = < (less than)
        - = > (greater than)
        - === (is equal in value and type)
        - !== (not equal in value and type)
     4. Boolean Operators
        - &&
        - ||
     5. Ternary operators
        - This assigns one of two values to a variable based on a condition.
     6. String Operator
        - -
        - This concatenates two strings

7. Functions

   - A function is a named sequence of statements that that perform a particular task.
   - Global functions or methods
     - Exmples of the global functions:
       1. String() - it converts an object value to a string
       2. parseInt() - it converts an object to an integer
       3. parseFloat() - it converts a string to a floating point number or decimal.

8. Strings, Math, Helper Function
   - Math - it gives us access to methods to perform some mathematical calculations
