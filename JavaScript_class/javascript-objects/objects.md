## JavaScript Objects

- An object in JavaScript is a collection of values that are named.
- These named values are known as properties.
- You can perform certain actions named as methods on different objects.
- An object method contains the definition of a function, and you can create and define an object in JavaScript.
- Object literal is considered the easiest way to create an object in JavaScript.
  - myObj = {}
- An object can also be created using the new keyword.
  - const car = new Object()
  - car.year = 2020
- An object must be addressed by a reference and not by a value.

### Object Properties
