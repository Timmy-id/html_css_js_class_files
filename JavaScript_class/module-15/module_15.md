1. Conditionals

   - Conditionals help us in making decisions based on some conditions.
   - We have types of conditional statements
     1. if statement - it runs a block of code if a condition is true.
     2. switch statement - a swtch statement performs a series of comparisons against a given expression. Where the comparison matches expression specified by the case keyword
     - components of the switch statement
       - switch
       - case
       - break - stop execution after a case has been run
       - default - if no previous case match our expression
     3. while loop
     4. do while loop
     5. for loop
     6. forEach (only works for array)

2. Truthy and Falsy values
   - Truthy values are values that are translate to true
   - Falsy values are values translated to false
   - examples of falsy values are:
     - false
     - 0
     - null
     - undefined
     - -0
     - ""
3. Short-circuting

   - We use the logical AND (&&) and logical OR (||) operators for short-circuiting

4. Break and Continue
   - Break exits a functioning loop.
   - Continue breaks the iteration that was specified in the conditional and it continue with the next iteration
